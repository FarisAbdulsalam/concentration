// plan

// 1. declare all variables, constants, cached element references, and event listeners
// constants: number of cards, array for the cards, winning score
// variables: state of game(whether the game is started or not), current score, attempts, two variables to hold cards for comparison purposes
// cached elements: start/reset button, the cards to click on, the win/lose messages
// event listeners: click event listeners for the cards and start/reset buttons

// 2. create an initialize function that resets all variables and readies the game for play. this function will be called upon
// clicking the start button

// 3. create a function that randomizes then renders all the cards on the screen 

// 4. a function that flips the cards after they're clicked

// 5. a function that compares two cards and adjusts attempts and score accordingly
